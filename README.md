# AnimalCrossingWTC
App for Animal Crossing fishing and bug catching.

The purpose of this app is to take the user's local time, and then display the bugs and fish that can be caught at the current time. 

Currently, this assumes that you have set your in game time to match the current local time. Functionality will be added to change the date/time to allow more flexibility.
